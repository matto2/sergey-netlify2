 the proper spelling of Irish names.</p>
<p><strong>Best option:</strong> Send a <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@%5Bxxx-company%5D+I+request+your+company+make+changes+to+your+service+to+accept+real+names+including+the+apostrophe+and+other+special+characters!+%23keeptheapostrophe+keeptheapostrophe.com">public tweet</a> to the offending company. Alternatively, you can use the sample complaint letter (below) as a starting point for your protest. And proudly wear our <a href="/">t-shirts</a> that calls for keeping the Irish apostrophe around for another 500 years. Think of it as the “keep” in Keep the Faith.” That covers many meanings: maintain, preserve, sustain, observe, support, respect, guard, and cherish. It will benefit all of us.</p>
<h5>Copy the text below then paste into a contact form as a starting point for your complaint.</h5>
<p><em>Dear Manager,</em></p>
<p><em>When I first created an account with your concern I entered my surname, which, when correctly spelt, includes an apostrophe. My properly done application was rejected by your system since it contained my so called &quot;foreign element.&quot; I thus was forced to mis-spell my own name to be accepted into your records.</em></p>
<p><em>I understand that malicious actors exist who exploit any security vulnerabilities that come with names having special characters in them. I further understand that with a bit of additional coding effort any possible security risks can be eliminated or greatly mitigated.</em></p>
<p><em>A substantial number of companies have figured out how to accept my apostrophe in their forms. Unfortunately, that turns out to present a further frustration: I have to remember or keep a record of which concerns do or don't spell my name correctly.</em></p>
<p><em>The purpose of this letter is to urge your developers to make any changes needed to accommodate me and hundreds of your other customers dealing with a similar frustration. I look forward to your reply and hopefully a resolution to this issue.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
