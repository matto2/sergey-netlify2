<h1>Sergey - Netlify</h1>
<p>Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to site atop your already brilliant HTML. In essence, Sergey is HTML + partials with slots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>This is a starter project that'll deploy to Netlify on your behalf. It demonstrates the two key features of Sergey: imports, and slots.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install

# Build the site
$ npm start

# Run Sergey in dev mode
$ npm run dev
</code></pre>
<h2>Issues</h2>
